# Chat Room Challenge

A simple chat room application similar to the Slack. Users will be able to sign up for your application. Send messages in public chat "channels", and even create new channels around topics of their choosing! Moreover, the program I built is a single-page applicationâ€”an interactive web app with multiple pages that doesn't require any additional page loads.
